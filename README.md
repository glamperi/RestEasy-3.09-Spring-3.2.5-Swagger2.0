# RestEasy-3.09-Spring-3.2.5-Swagger2.0
Jboss EAP 6 (Jboss 7) RestEasy 3.09 Spring 3.2.5 Swagger 2.0 Swagger UI Integration with web.xml and bean config

For this to run, you must upgrade your RestEasy installation to 3.09 

Instructions from: http://docs.jboss.org/resteasy/docs/3.0.9.Final/userguide/html_single/#upgrading-as7

Resteasy is bundled with JBoss AS 7. You will likely have the need to upgrade Resteasy in AS7. The Resteasy distribution comes with a zip file called resteasy-jboss-modules-3.0.9.Final.zip. Unzip this file while with the modules/ directory of the JBoss AS7 distribution. This will overwrite some of the existing files there.

Swagger UI Can be accessed here: http://localhost:8080/rest/index.html

Any Suggestions for improvement appreciated.
